## Document Organization and Folder Structures

You create nested folder structures to mirror your project's architecture. Hugo Dias supports unlimited nesting, custom slugs, and automatic table of contents generation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the dashboard and click "New Folder". Name it based on your project sections, like `api-reference` or `user-guides`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-text">
    Drag and drop MDX files into folders or use the upload button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Hierarchy" icon="settings">
    Edit folder metadata for ordering and visibility.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here is a sample folder structure:

```bash
docs/
├── introduction.mdx
├── api/
│   ├── endpoints.mdx
│   └── authentication.mdx
└── guides/
    ├── quickstart.mdx
    └── troubleshooting.mdx
```

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use descriptive folder names to improve navigation. Hugo Dias auto-generates sidebar menus from your structure.
</Callout>

## Collaboration Tools for Teams

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Comments" icon="message-circle">
    Highlight text and leave inline feedback.
    
    ```javascript
    // Example comment on this code
    const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY; // @reviewer: Add validation here?
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Approvals" icon="check-circle">
    Set up workflows requiring peer review before publishing.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Real-time Edits" icon="edit-3">
    Multiple users edit simultaneously with live cursors.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version Control for Docs

Integrate Hugo Dias with Git repositories. You commit changes, create branches for drafts, and merge updates safely.

<CodeGroup tabs="GitHub, GitLab">
  ```bash
  # Connect your repo
  git remote add hugodias https://git.hugodias.example.com/project-docs.git
  git push origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # Branch for new feature docs
  git checkout -b feature/new-api-docs
  git commit -m "Add API endpoints documentation"
  git push origin feature/new-api-docs
  ```
</CodeGroup>

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Main Branch] --> B[Draft Branch]
    B --> C[Review & Merge]
    C --> A
    D[Publish] --> A
```

## Search and Indexing Functionality

Hugo Dias indexes your entire documentation set for lightning-fast searches. You query by keywords, filter by sections, and get highlighted results.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Options" default-open="false">
  Use operators like `AND`, `OR`, and exact phrases:
  
  | Operator | Example | Result |
  |----------|---------|--------|
  | `AND` | `API AND auth` | Pages with both terms |
  | `"exact phrase"` | `"user authentication"` | Exact matches |
  | `section:guides` | `troubleshooting section:guides` | Filter by folder |
  
  Results load in `<50ms` even for large docs.
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="info">
  Rebuild your index after major updates to ensure accuracy.
